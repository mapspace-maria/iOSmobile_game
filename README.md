The adaptation of a demo game in Unity to the Android mobile platform was requested. The Apple development support was installed in Unity Hub, and the development platform was changed to iOS in Build Settings. Additionally, the Apple mobile device was prepared for installing and testing the application by enabling the development mode and USB debugging.

Then, the game's input system was adapted for mobile devices. One option was to use a joystick or gamepad, or a mouse simulation provided by Unity for touchscreens. For this purpose, a package called Standard Assets from the Asset Store could be used, which included numerous controls for mobile devices.

Finally, a vibration effect was added to the game to enhance the user experience on mobile devices.
